abstract = {Abstract Conference key agreement (CKA), or multipartite key distribution, is a cryptographic task where more than two parties wish to establish a common secret key. A composition of bipartite quantum key distribution protocols can accomplish this task. However, the existence of multipartite quantum correlations allows for new and potentially more efficient protocols, to be applied in future quantum networks. Here, the existing quantum CKA protocols based on multipartite entanglement are reviewed, both in the device-dependent and the device-independent scenario.},

journal = {Quantum Science and Technology},
abstract = {In the implementation of device-independent (DI) quantum key distribution (QKD) we are interested in maximizing the key rate, i.e. the number of key bits that can be obtained per signal, for a fixed security parameter. In the finite size regime, we furthermore also care about the minimum number of signals required before key can be obtained at all. Here, we perform a fully finite size analysis of device independent protocols using the CHSH inequality both for collective and coherent attacks. For coherent attacks, we sharpen the results recently derived in Arnon-Friedman et al (2018 Nat. Commun. 9 459), to reduce the minimum number of signals before key can be obtained. In the regime of collective attacks, where the devices are restricted to have no memory, we employ two different techniques that exploit this restriction to further reduce the number of signals. We then discuss experimental platforms in which DIQKD may be implemented. We analyse Bell violations and expected QBER achieved in previous Bell tests with distant setups and situate these parameters in the security analysis. Moreover, focusing on one of the experimental platforms, namely nitrogen-vacancy based systems, we describe experimental improvements that can lead to a DI QKD implementation in the near future.}
