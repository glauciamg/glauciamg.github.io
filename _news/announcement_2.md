<strong>PhD position in Multipartite quantum networks</strong>

The quantum information theory group at the Institute for Theoretical Physics, University of Düsseldorf (Germany), is inviting applications for a PhD position within the project 'Multipartite quantum networks' led by Gláucia Murta. The position is funded by the Cluster of Excellence Matter and Light for Quantum Computing (<a href="https://ml4q.de/">ML4Q</a>).

The successful candidate will work on quantum correlations and their applications to quantum communication and network protocols. The PhD candidate will collaborate with national and international partners. In particular, the project involves close collaboration with quantum optics experimentalists in investigating and benchmarking new sources of multipartite entanglement.

Candidates should send a full CV including certificates and a list of publications to <a href="mailto:glaucia.murta@uni-duesseldorf.de">glaucia.murta@uni-duesseldorf.de</a>.  Please include electronic contact details of two referees. Further information on the position is available upon request. The deadline is <strong>January 23, 2023</strong>.
