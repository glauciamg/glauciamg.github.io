I am an Assistant Professor at the Atominstitut of TU Wien, where I lead the research group on [Quantum Foundations and Cryptography](https://www.quitphysics.info/q-found-crypto) within the Quantum Optics and Quantum Information research area.

Our research focuses on the study of fundamental aspects of quantum correlations and their application to quantum communication and cryptography. In particular, we investigate how the fundamental aspects of Bell nonlocality can be used for quantum cryptography, leading to protocols resilient to hacking. Also, we investigate how multipartite quantum correlations and high dimensional systems can overcome the limitations of bipartite qubit systems, leading to more efficient protocols and the development of new quantum functionalities.

<a>Academic Journey:</a> I’m originally from Belo Horizonte, Brazil, where I obtained my Bachelor, Master, and PhD degree in Physics from the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG). My PhD research was devoted to fundamental aspects of quantum nonlocality and I spent one year as a visiting student at the Quantum Information Center in Gdańsk (KCIK), Poland.  From 2016 to 2019 I worked as a postdoc researcher at QuTech -TUDelft in the Netherlands at Stephanie Whener’s group in the efforts for the quantum internet. And from 2019 to 2024 I was a Principal Investigator in the cluster of excellence Matter and Light for Quantum Computing (ML4Q), working in the group of Dagmar Bruß at the Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf. I joined TUWien in June 2024.
