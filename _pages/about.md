I am an Assistant Professor at the Atominstitut of TU Wien, where I lead the research group on [Quantum Foundations and Cryptography](https://www.quitphysics.info/q-found-crypto) within the Quantum Optics and Quantum Information research area.

Our research focuses on the study of fundamental aspects of quantum correlations and their application to quantum communication and cryptography. In particular, we investigate how the fundamental aspects of Bell nonlocality can be used for quantum cryptography, leading to protocols resilient to hacking. Also, we investigate how multipartite quantum correlations and high dimensional systems can overcome the limitations of bipartite qubit systems, leading to more efficient protocols and the development of new quantum functionalities.
