<h4><strong><span style="color: var(--global-theme-color)">Podcast O Q Quântico</span>(more info coming soon)</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

  <h5>  
Currently in the production phase, the podcast ‘O Q Quântico’  aims at introducing
basic concepts of quantum theory to the general public while confronting misinformation and
pseudo-science. We also aim at bringing visibility to the quantum information community in
Brazil by interviewing researchers from different universities in the podcast. The project is developed in collaboration
with Leonardo Guerini, from Universidade Federal de Santa Maria, and Revista Arco, also
from Universidade Federal de Santa Maria, and is supported by the INCT de Informação Quântica and the Cluster of Excellence Matter and Light for Quantum Computing.<h5>
