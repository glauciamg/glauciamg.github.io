<h4><strong><span style="color: var(--global-theme-color)">Podcast O Q Quântico</span>(more info coming soon)</strong></h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

  <h5>  
The podcast ‘O Q Quântico’, which is currently in the production phase, aims at introducing
basic concepts of quantum theory to the general public while confronting misinformation and
pseudo-science. We also aim at bringing visibility to the quantum information community in
Brazil by regularly interviewing researchers in the podcast. The project developed in collaboration
with Prof. Leonardo Guerini, from Universidade Federal de Santa Maria, and Revista Arco, also
from Universidade Federal de Santa Maria, and supported by the INCT de Informação Quântica and the cluster of Excellence Matter and Light for Quantum Computing.<h5>
